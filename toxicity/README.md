# Sentence Toxicity
## Model used
The Universal Sentence Encoder Lite module- is a lightweight version of USE(Universal Sentence Encoder). This lite version is good for use cases when your computation resource is limited.USE is which is a model that encodes text into 512-dimensional embedding (or, in other words, a list of 512 floating-point numbers). These embeddings can be used as starting points for language processing tasks such as sentiment classification and textual similarity analysis.

## Dataset
Civil Research Data(Collection of user-generated online news comments published from 2015-2017 as part of a now-defunct commenting platform. For use in furthering research into online toxicity, bias, and harassment.)

## What Model does?
The model is trained and optimized for greater-than-word length text, such as sentences, phrases or short paragraphs. It is trained on a variety of data sources and a variety of tasks with the aim of dynamically accommodating a wide variety of natural language understanding tasks. The input is variable-length English text and the output is a 512-dimensional vector.
